# Windows-startup_script
Simple tool to do all the setup I manually do everytime I re-install windows 10(maybe in the future 11)

Currently working:
1. firefox_setup_downloader.py 
# Downloads a firefox setup .exe file for installation without needing to deal with MS-Edge, and their intrusive popups.
2. disable_uac.ps1 
# TODO: Gotta find a way to implement it into the script, without having to run in manually as administrator.

TODO:
A LOT!
1. fix setup_firefox.py and make it work properly
2. finish everything else..!
3. add support for windows 11 (currently only doing this for windows 10, as that's the OS I use the most)
